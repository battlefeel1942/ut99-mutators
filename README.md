# Unreal Tournament '99 Mutators: Airstrike and NoGuns

## Mutators

### AirstrikeMutator

Prepare for an explosive experience with **AirstrikeMutator**! This fun addition brings an element of surprise and danger to the arena by periodically bombarding players with rockets from the sky. Here’s what to expect:

- **Random Rocket Rain**: Every so often, the sky lights up with rockets aiming close to player locations. Expect some near misses and direct hits!
- **Warning Signals**: Just before the rockets start their descent, players are warned to brace themselves—or find a futile attempt at cover.
- **Customize the Chaos**: Adjust how often the airstrikes happen, the speed of the rockets, and even how randomly they target the area around each player.

### NoGunsMutator

Imagine a world where the only thing you can shoot is a harsh look. **NoGunsMutator** strips the game of all firearms, challenging players to rethink their strategy in a gun-free environment. Here's the twist:

- **Utterly Unarmed**: All weapon spawns are disabled. That's right, no guns at all—not even the sly Enforcer.
- **Standoff**: Since there's no melee combat in UT99, players will need to rely on evasion, strategy, and the environment to outlast their opponents. It's a true test of survival!

## Installation

1. Download the `.mut` files for each mutator.
2. Place them in your Unreal Tournament `System` directory.
3. Enable the mutators from the game settings before starting your match.

## Playing Tips

- **AirstrikeMutator**: Keep an eye on the timer and heed the warnings. There’s no safe place during an airstrike, but awareness might just keep you alive a bit longer.
- **NoGunsMutator**: Without weapons, your best bet is to master the art of dodging and using the map’s hazards to your advantage. It’s a great time to perfect your tactical retreats and surprise cornering!
